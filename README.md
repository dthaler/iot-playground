# Purpose
Personal repository for documentation on stuff I am working on. If you want to access the private repo just contact me.

## OMA LWM2M 
A device management protocol, provides interfaces for basic management operations. Built on top of CoAP introduces the object model was used by IPSO. I use [Wakamaa](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama) for testing.

## IPSO
IPSO Objects define data models and resources per device. Their main purpose is to...
*  ... provide application interoperability.
*  ... make it simple to add new resources.
*  ... find common design pattern that is independent of the protocol used.
*  ... to provide the building blocks to semantically define more complex devices.

## W3C

## OIC
