# Purpose
Personal repository for playing with IPSO-based objects. 

## IPSO Objects
IPSO Objects define data models and resources per device. Their main purpose is to...
*  ... provide application interoperability.
*  ... make it simple to add new resources.
*  ... find common design pattern that is independent of the protocol used.
*  ... to provide the building blocks to semantically define more complex devices.

This type of object model was firstly introduced by LWM2M. IPSO introduced reusable resources that you can test with [Wakamaa](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama) and Leshan implementations.
